I have got my master's degree at the Computer Vision Institute, Shenzhen University, under the supervision of Prof.[Feng Liu](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=45uLWocAAAAJ) and Prof.[Linlin Shen](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=AZ_y9HgAAAAJ). Besides, I was an intern at Jarvis Lab, Tencent. My major research interests include image & video generation and system security.

[Dynamically Masked Discriminator for GANs.](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2306.07716.pdf) 

**Wentian Zhang**, Haozhe Liu, Bing Li, Jinheng Xie, Yawen Huang, Yuexiang Li, Yefeng Zheng, Bernard Ghanem

- In the GAN training, We observe that the discriminator model, trained on historically generated data, often slows down its adaptation to the changes in the new arrival generated data, which accordingly decreases the quality of generated results. We propose a new discriminator, which automatically detects its retardation and then dynamically masks its features, such that the discriminator can adaptively learn the temporally-vary distribution of generated data.

- Training GANs is difficult since the training distribution is dynamic for the discriminator, leading to unstable image representation. We address the problem of training GANs from a novel perspective, i.e., robust image classification. We propose a simple yet effective module, namely AdaptivelyMix, for GANs, which shrinks the regions of training data in the image representation space of the discriminator.

[Decoupled Mixup for Out-of-Distribution Visual Recognition.](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2210.14783.pdf)

- We propose a novel ‚ÄùDecoupled-Mixup‚Äù method to train CNN models for OOD visual recognition. Different from previous work combining pairs of images homogeneously, our method decouples each image into discriminative and noise-prone regions, and then heterogeneously combine these regions of image pairs to train CNN models.

[Effective Presentation Attack Detection Driven by Face Related Task](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-031-20065-6_24)

- Unlike face PAD task, other face related tasks trained by huge amount of real faces (e.g. face recognition and attribute editing) can be effectively adopted into different application scenarios. Inspired by this, we propose to trade position of PAD and face related work in a face system and apply the free acquired prior knowledge from face related tasks to solve face PAD, so as to improve the generalization ability in detecting PAs.

[A Multi-task Network with Weight Decay Skip Connection Training for Anomaly Detection in Retinal Fundus Images](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-031-16434-7_63)

**Wentian Zhang**;, Xu Sun;, Yuexiang Li;, Haozhe Liu, Nanjun He, Feng Liu, Yefeng Zheng
  
- We propose a weight decay training strategy to progressively mute the skip connections of U-Net, which effectively adapts U-shape network to anomaly detection task. Furthermore, we formulate histograms of oriented gradients (HOG) prediction to encourage the framework to deeply exploit contextual information from fundus images.
