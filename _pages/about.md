I am studying for my master's degree at the Computer Vision Institute, Shenzhen University, under the supervision of Prof.[Feng Liu](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=45uLWocAAAAJ) and Prof.[Linlin Shen](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=AZ_y9HgAAAAJ). Besides, I am an intern at Jarvis Lab, Tencent. My major research interests include Self-supervised Learning, Anomaly Detection and Graph Embedding.

[Decoupled Mixup for Out-of-Distribution Visual Recognition.](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2210.14783.pdf)

- We propose a novel ‚ÄùDecoupled-Mixup‚Äù method to train CNN models for OOD visual recognition. Different from previous work combining pairs of images homogeneously, our method decouples each image into discriminative and noise-prone regions, and then heterogeneously combine these regions of image pairs to train CNN models.

[Effective Presentation Attack Detection Driven by Face Related Task](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-031-20065-6_24)

- Unlike face PAD task, other face related tasks trained by huge amount of real faces (e.g. face recognition and attribute editing) can be effectively adopted into different application scenarios. Inspired by this, we propose to trade position of PAD and face related work in a face system and apply the free acquired prior knowledge from face related tasks to solve face PAD, so as to improve the generalization ability in detecting PAs.

[A Multi-task Network with Weight Decay Skip Connection Training for Anomaly Detection in Retinal Fundus Images](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-031-16434-7_63)

**Wentian Zhang**&#8224;, Xu Sun&#8224;, Yuexiang Li&#8224;, Haozhe Liu, Nanjun He, Feng Liu, Yefeng Zheng  (**&#8224; Equal Contribution**)
  
- We propose a weight decay training strategy to progressively mute the skip connections of U-Net, which effectively adapts U-shape network to anomaly detection task. Furthermore, we formulate histograms of oriented gradients (HOG) prediction to encourage the framework to deeply exploit contextual information from fundus images.
